# main components of kubernetes
Containers: Kubernetes operates with containers, which are a lightweight, portable, and self-sufficient encapsulation of application code and dependencies.

Pods: The basic scheduling unit in Kubernetes is a pod, which can contain one or more containers that are tightly coupled and share resources.

Nodes: A node is a worker machine (physical or virtual) in Kubernetes, where pods are scheduled and run. Nodes are managed by the control plane.

Cluster: A Kubernetes cluster is a set of nodes grouped together. The cluster is responsible for running the application containers and ensuring their availability.
